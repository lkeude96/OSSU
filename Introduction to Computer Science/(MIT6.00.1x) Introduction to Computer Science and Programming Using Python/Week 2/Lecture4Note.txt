Creating Functions
===================
Functions give us abstractions - allow us to capture computation and treat as if primitive
def <function name (<formal parameters>):
  <function body

Environments
===============
Environments are formalism for tracking bindings of variables and values
Assignments pair name and value in environment
Asking for value of name just looks up in current environment
Definitions pair function name with details of function

Modules
=========
Modularity suggests grouping functions together that share common theme
