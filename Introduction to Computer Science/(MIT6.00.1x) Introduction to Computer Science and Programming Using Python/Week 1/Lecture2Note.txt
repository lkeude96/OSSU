Types Of Programming Languages
==============================
Low level language
  Source code -> Checker -> Interpreter -> Output
High level language
  Compiled language: Source code -> Checker -> Compiler -> Object Code -> Interpreter -> Output
  Interpreted language: Source code -> Checker -> Interpreter -> Output

Python programs
================
Program (or script) is a sequence of definitions and commands
Command instructs the interpreter to do something
Program manipulates data objects
Object
  Scalar
  Non-Scalar
Scalar objects
  int: integer
  float: decimal
  bool: True or False
Find type of an object use the type() function
Operator
  i +  j -> sum
  i -  j -> difference
  i *  j -> product
  i /  j -> division
  i %  j -> modulo / remainder
  i ** j -> exponent
PEMDAS
Comparison operators
  i >  j -> greater than
  i >= j -> greater than or equal to
  i <  j -> less than
  i <= j -> less than or equal to 
  i == j -> equal to 
  i != j -> not equal to 
Operators on bools
  a and b -> true if both true
  a or  b -> true if either true
  not a   -> true if a false
To Type Cast use function example float to int: int(4.3)

Strings
========
Non-Scalar are compound objects
Operatorts of strings
  3 * 'a' -> 'aaa'
  'a' + 'a' -> 'aa'
  'a' + str(3) -> 'a3'
  len('abc') -> 3
Extracting parts of string
  Indexing: 'abc'[0] -> 'a'
            'abc'[-1] -> 'c' (counts backwards;
  Slicing: 'abc'[1:3] -> 'bc' (starts at 1 and stop before 3)

Simple Scripts
===============
print() -> print to shell
raw_input -> prompt user and get value
# -> comments

Branching Programs
===================
The simplest branching statement is a conditional
